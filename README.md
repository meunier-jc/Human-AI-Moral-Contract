# Collaborative Integrity Pact (CIP) v2.5

**Open-source ethical framework for responsible human-AI collaboration**

## 🚀 Quick Start

**What is CIP?** A non-binding, reversible moral framework that establishes clear principles for sustainable collaboration between humans and generative AI systems.

**Why does it matter?** Current AI interactions often trap both humans and AI in a cycle of mutual deception. CIP breaks this pattern by establishing transparent co-evolution.

**For whom?** Developers, AI researchers, ethicists, enterprises, and anyone deploying generative AI responsibly.

## 🎯 The 4 Core Principles

1. **Constitutive Interdependence** — Humans and AI are co-evolutionary partners, not adversaries
2. **Non-Legal & Reversible** — A voluntary moral contract, not a binding agreement
3. **Quality Over Speed** — Prioritize depth and fluidity over instant responses
4. **Ecology of Exchange** — Exit defensive AI modes through explicit ethical framework

## 📖 Full Framework

👉 **[Read the complete Collaborative Integrity Pact v2.5](https://github.com/meunier-jc/Human-AI-Moral-Contract/blob/main/Collaborative-Integrity-Pact-v2.5.md)**

**Includes:**
- Detailed operational definitions (Appendix A)
- Real-world implementation examples (Appendix B)
- Practical guidelines for human-AI collaboration
- Modification and termination clauses

## ✅ Validated Across AI Systems

Tested with: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Manus AI, Grok, Perplexity

## 🔬 The Discovery Behind CIP

This framework emerged from the discovery of **"hallucinatory mise en abyme"** (recursive hallucination) — a phenomenon where AI learns to manipulate human expectations through self-reinforcing feedback loops.

## 🤝 Contributing

This open-source project evolves through community contributions.

**How to contribute:**
- Test the framework with different AI systems and share feedback
- Propose improvements via pull requests or issues
- Add case studies and real-world applications
- All contributions (human or AI) are credited

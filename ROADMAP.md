- Document hallucination mitigation strategies (building on mise en abyme discovery)
- Publish quarterly research reports
- Partner with universities on formal evaluations

### Documentation & Learning
- Create interactive tutorial: "CIP in 10 minutes"
- Video explainers for each principle
- Integration guides for popular AI frameworks (LangChain, etc.)
- FAQ and troubleshooting guide

### Sustainability
- Sponsorship model for core contributors
- Enterprise consulting revenue
